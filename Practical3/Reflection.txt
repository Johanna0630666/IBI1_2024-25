This is my first time to learn Git and GitHub, and some operation methods are unfamiliar to me. 
Especially about the use of terminals, such as creating a new branch, making modifications, and merging changes into the master branch. 
However, these operations also give me a deeper understanding of workflow. Moreover, forking an existing repository, cloning it locally, and pushing my own changes are also challenging. 
But after discussing with my classmates and consulting with the teacher, I can gradually complete these operations better. 
This practical makes me feel very fruitful because I can gradually master a new technique skill. 
At the same time, I also realize the strong ability of Git and Github in working together as they can contribute to collaborative coding environments. 
After this practical activity, I decided to improve my python ability so that I can program more interesting and complex projects in the future!
