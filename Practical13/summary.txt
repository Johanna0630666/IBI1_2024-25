Subcellular localisation: Mitochondrion (mitochondrial matrix)

2. UniProt Online BLAST Results
Range of percentage identities in BLAST hits: 58.1% to 100%
Best match: Mouse SOD2 (UniProt ID: P09671)
Identity with human SOD2: 90.1%

3. Python-Based Sequence Alignment Results
Comparison	BLOSUM62 Score	Percentage Identity
Human vs Mouse	1097.0	90.09009009009009%
Human vs Random	-216.0	4.954954954954955%
Mouse vs Random	-195.0	5.855855855855856%

4. Interpretation and Conclusion
The sequence alignment results clearly show that the human and mouse SOD2 proteins are the most closely related. This is supported by both a high BLOSUM62 score (1097.0) and a high percentage identity (90.09%) in the Python-based analysis, which aligns closely with the BLAST result (90.1%).
In contrast, both the human–random and mouse–random comparisons yielded very low alignment scores and identity percentages (approximately 5%), indicating that the random sequence does not represent a biologically related protein.
Statement: Among the three comparisons, the human and mouse SOD2 sequences are most closely related, demonstrating strong evolutionary conservation.
