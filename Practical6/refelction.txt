This practice is both challenging and rewarding for me.
The basic SIR model is relatively easy to implement, with clear logic and intuitive parameter control. 
However, when implementing the two-dimensional spatial propagation model (spatial_SIR.py), the difficulty increases significantly, especially in drawing dynamic diagrams. 

I especially like to observe how the infection spreads step by step in the grid. 
Through animation, I can feel the spread of the disease very intuitively.
This visual simulation has enhanced my understanding of the transmission mechanism of infectious disease models.

The most difficult part for me is to update the dynamic diagram correctly at every time step.
When learning to use Matplotlib's interactive drawing functions (such as plt.ion, plt.pause, ax.clear), I encountered some technical problems and debugged several times to achieve the expected effect.
But when I finally saw the animation running smoothly, I felt a sense of accomplishment.

This practice made me realize the significant impact of spatial structure on disease transmission, and also improved my ability to use NumPy and Matplotlib for simulation and visualization.

In general, this practice is very meaningful, which not only deepens my understanding of the SIR model, but also exercises my programming and problem-solving skills.
