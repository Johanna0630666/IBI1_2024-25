I received a score of 98.55 out of 100. The two minor issues were as follows:

1.File: mystery_code.py
I did not explicitly state that the random numbers must be within the range of 1 to 6.
To address this, I clarified this requirement in the pseudocode, ensuring the intended behavior is clearly communicated.

2.File: Programming_language_popularity.py
I initially omitted printing the dictionary.
To resolve this, I added a line in the code to explicitly print the dictionary, as required.

These small adjustments have been made to improve clarity and completeness in both files.
